## R Tutorial Activity 1: Intro to R
### Download R
***
1. R. The R Project for Statistical Computing. Available at: <https://cran.r-project.org/>  
Select: "Download R for (Linux/macOS/Windows)" and follow the instructions.

2. R Studio Desktop. Available at: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>  
Scroll down to find your installer, ex: "RSTUDIO-2024.04.2-764.EXE" for Windows

### Starting R
***
Once you have installed both R and RStudio, you will be able to start the RStudio application. The console, where you can begin to execute commands, is in the bottom left containing the `> `  
  
Recommended Reading: The R Book, Chapter 2 "Essentials of the R Language"  
Available [here](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca/doi/epdf/10.1002/9781118448908.ch2)

### R as a Calculator
***
```{r}
# The basic operations are "*, +, -, /, ^"
# R skips any line beginning with a "#", very useful for keeping your code clean
# R does not require a semicolon to end each line, one can still be used to combine lines for legibility
2+3; 2*3; 2/3; 2^3; 2*(3+1)^2

```

### Variables
***
```{r}
# You can store results in variables and use them in calculations.
x = 2+3

# When you assign a value to a variable it does not print the answer to the screen. You can see the value of x by using x as a command.
x

y = 1+2
x*y

z = x^y
z

# R has another notation for assignment: the arrow: <- . Many R programmers use this. It may seem odd to programmers coming from other languages.
x <- 3
x

x <- 5.412
x
```
Look [here](https://statisticsglobe.com/assignment-operators-in-r) for an explanation of the differences between "=" and "<-".

### Vectors
***
A vector is a type of list. Often it is a list of numbers, but it can be a list of other types such as characters.
You create vectors by using the c() function (concatenate).
```{r}
# A vector with 4 entries
c(1, 2, 3, 4)

# You can store vectors in variables.
x = c(1.1, 0.0, 3.14, 2.718)
x

# Of course using the arrow instead of equal sign works here.
x <- c(2,4,6)
x

# Sequences of integers are so common that there is a shortcut for making them.
1:4; 3:10; 9:2

# A long vector will be displayed over several lines. The number at the start of each line in brackets is the index of the first entry on that line.
x = 1:40
x
```


### Functions
***
R has all the functions you know and love. (Most of them can be used on vectors.)
```{r}
# We'll start with functions numbers
sin(1); sin(1.4); sin(3)

# R knows about pi
pi

sin(pi/2)

# The exponential function is given by 'exp'.
exp(0); exp(1)

# factorial:  n!
factorial(8)

# n choose k 
factorial(8)/(factorial(3)*factorial(8-3))

# n choose k: a built in function!
choose(8,3)

# Sum and mean functions on vectors. They take the sum and average respectively of the vectors entries
x = 1:6
x

sum(x)

mean(x)

# Example: find the sum of the integers from 1 to 1024.
x = 1:1024
sum(x)

# This can be done in one command.
sum(1:1024)

# Functions can have required and optional variables that must be passed through
# For example, the function 'mean' is described this way:
```
![](Images/mean-rdocs.png)

```{r}
# If the data in the vector Y includes NA the default mean function doesnâ€™t work properly
Y <- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5, 6, NA, 9, 10, NA)
mean(Y)

# this is the same as the default
mean(Y, na.rm=FALSE)     

# Now, changing the argument to TRUE
mean(Y, na.rm=TRUE)
```

### Getting Help
***
R and RStudio have complete documentation on all R functions. The lower right pane in RStudio has a help tab you can use. The help contains a lot of information, so you will have to learn to filter out what you don't need. Try to use the R Documentation before taking your query to your favourite search engine.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# You can also access the help directly from the console tab. This will open the R Documentation for the 'mean()' function.
help(mean)
# or
?mean
```
