## Download R
1. R. The R Project for Statistical Computing. Available at: <https://cran.r-project.org/>  
Select: "Download R for (Linux/macOS/Windows)" and follow the instructions.

2. R Studio Desktop. Available at: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>  
Scroll down to find your installer, ex: "RSTUDIO-2024.04.2-764.EXE" for Windows

***

## Starting R
Once you have installed both R and RStudio, you will be able to start the RStudio application. The console, where you can begin to execute commands, is in the bottom left containing the `> `

## Keeping Your Code Clean
It is important when sharing your code and for your own sanity to document your code well. R will skip any line of code that begins with a '#'

```{r}
x = 5
# x = 4
x
x = 4
x
```

***
## R as a Calculator
The basic operations are "*, +, -, /, ^"

```{r}
2+3 
2*3 
2/3 
2^3
2*(3+1)^2
```

***
## Variables
You can store results in variables and use them in calculations. You can print the value of a variable by using it as a command.

```{r}
x = 2+3

x

y = 1+2
x*y

z = x^y
z
```

R has another notation for assignment: the arrow: <- . Many R programmers use this. It may seem odd to programmers coming from other languages.
```{r}
x <- 3
x

x <- 5.412
x
```
Look [here](https://statisticsglobe.com/assignment-operators-in-r) for an explanation of the differences between "=" and "<-".

### Variable Types  
**Character:** free text, a.k.a. string\
**Factor:** Categorical values; actual values may be text (North/South/East/West) or numbers (1/2/3/4)\
**Logical:** Binary (TRUE/FALSE)\
**Integer:** Whole numbers (1L/2L/3L/4L, the letter 'L' declares these as Integers)\
**Numeric:** Decimal Numbers (1.5/2.5/3.5/4.5)  

***
## Vectors
A vector stores a collection of any datatype.
You create vectors by using the c() function (concatenate).
```{r}
# A vector with 4 entries
c(1, 2, 3, 4)

x = c(1.1, 0.0, 3.14, 2.718)
x
```

One way to access specific values within a vector is use the index of that value 
```{r}
x[1]
x[4]
```

Sequences of integers are so common that there is a shortcut for making them.
```{r}
1:4
9:2
# or 
seq(1,2,0.1)
```

A long vector will be displayed over several lines. The number at the start of each line in brackets is the index of the first entry on that line.
```{r}
x = 1:40
x
```

***
## Arrays, Matrices, Data Frames
Stuff about arrays and matrices
```{r}

## Data Tables
data.tables are hype
```{r}

```

## Functions
R has all the functions you know and love. (Most of them can be used on vectors.)
```{r}
sin(1)
sin(1.4)
sin(3)

# R knows about pi
pi

sin(pi/2)

# The exponential function
exp(0)
exp(1)

# factorial:  n!
factorial(8)

# n choose k 
factorial(8)/(factorial(3)*factorial(8-3))

# a built in function!
choose(8,3)
```

Sum and mean functions on vectors. They take the sum and average respectively of the vectors entries
```{r}
x = 1:6
x

sum(x)

mean(x)
```

Example: find the sum of the integers from 1 to 1024.
```{r}
x = 1:1024
sum(x)

# This can be done in one command.
sum(1:1024)
```

Functions can have required and optional variables that must be passed through.
For example, the function 'mean' is described this way:
![](images/mean-rdocs.png)
If the data in the vector Y includes NA the default mean function doesnâ€™t work properly.
```{r}
Y <- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5, 6, NA, 9, 10, NA)
mean(Y)

# Same as the default
mean(Y, na.rm=FALSE)     

# Changing the argument to TRUE
mean(Y, na.rm=TRUE)
```

### Custom Functions
Make your own
```{r}

```

## If statements and Loops  
R supports logical conditions:  

| Operator | Name           | Example |  
|:----------:|---------------|:---------:|   
| ==      | Equal                     | x == y |  
| !=      | Not equal                 | x != y |  
| >      | Greater than              | x > y |  
| <       | Less than                 | x < y |  
| >=     | Greater than or equal to | x >= y |  
| <=      | Less than or equal to     | x <= y |

## Getting Help
R and RStudio have complete documentation on all R functions. The lower right pane in RStudio has a help tab you can use. The help contains a lot of information, so you will have to learn to filter out what you don't need. Try to use the R Documentation before taking your query to your favourite search engine.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# You can also access the help directly from the console tab. This will open the R Documentation for the 'mean()' function.
help(mean)
# or
?mean
```
